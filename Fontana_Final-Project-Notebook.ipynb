    "**This notebook looks at two data sets analyzing City of Pittsburgh parks, courts, and rinks to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Our group's criteria for best neighborhood is the best neighborhood for children. This will be determined on multiple factors including amount of local parks, courts, and rinks, and the types of of each of these items. My partner will also be analyzing information about playgrounds and playground equipment best suited for children. Neighborhoods will be ranked based on certain criteria. The best neighborhood will be a neighborhood with plenty of access to parks, courts, rinks, and playgrounds, and the best quality locations for each. The best neighborhood will be great for promoting exercise, healthy habits, and emotional well being for children. Notice that some parks overlap neighborhoods. For this particular analysis, we have chosen to ignore this piece of information.**"

    "**Squirrel Hill South, in the top rankings for every single category, is ranked first overall in both data sets. Squirrel Hill South has 6 parks, ranked fifth by number of parks and by region the parks are in. Squirrel Hill South was also ranked first for both categories I analyzed in the courts and rinks data set with 26 courts/rinks and having 4 different top court/rink types including Basketball (Full), Tennis, Hockey, and Pickleball. I have concluded that based on my two data sets and the analysis I performed, Squirrel Hill South is the best neighborhood to live in. This neighborhood would be great for children with access to many parks, courts, and rinks while also being located in regions and having a multitude of different types of courts and rinks. Squirrel Hill South also contains part of Schenly Park, which showed up quite frequently in the courts and rinks data set. Squirrel Hill South also has Davis Park and Frick Park. This park had 16 different courts or rinks which could be used by children, making Squirrel Hill South a great neighborhood overall.**"

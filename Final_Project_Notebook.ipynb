We are using the criterias to find the best neighborhood for children named our final project as` Children's Friendly Neighborhood In Pittsburgh`. In this project , we will determine the best neighborhood for children based on the various factors like the number of local parks, courts, rinks, and playgrounds, and playground equipment.Neighborhoods will be ranked based on certain criteria. The best neighborhood will be a neighborhood with plenty of access to parks, courts, rinks, and playgrounds, and the best quality locations for each. The best neighborhood will be great for promoting exercise, healthy habits, and emotional well being for children. Notice that some parks overlap neighborhoods. For this particular analysis, we have chosen to ignore this piece of information.**"

This neighborhood would be great for children with access to many parks, courts, and rinks while also being located in regions and having a multitude of different types of courts and rinks. Squirrel Hill South also contains part of Schenly Park, which showed up quite frequently in the courts and rinks data set. Squirrel Hill South also has Davis Park and Frick Park.
